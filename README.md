# st332proj2

This is the git repository for ST332 Project 2.

Questions to answer:

1. Which sub-scale data are missing? How? 
2. Which missingness methods are best fit to the CAST data?
3. Which missingness model best fits the sub-scale data?
4. How is Yscore missing?
5. Which missingness methods are best fit? How do they impact the final results?

Files are organized in 3 sub-folders:
* /data/ contains all relevant data for further analysis
* /processing/ for R code to produce clean subsets of data
* /notebook/ for production-ready R Markdown files (two sub-folders: sub-scales and Yscore)
